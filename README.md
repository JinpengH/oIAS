## Introduction
The Invoice Approval System is a full-stack web application designed and implemented for ObEN. It aims to streamline the process of internal invoice approving, which is now conducted by email correspondence. We are working to make this process smooth and efficient by building this web application so that the relevant parties are able to track the processing of their invoice. This web application supports user sign-up/login, submitting invoices, viewing, searching, and sorting invoice history, and approving/disapproving invoices. When deployed on cloud platform, it will also incorporate security features that keep the user information and uploaded files securely stored.
